Cloudinary
==========

## About
The Cloudinary Java SDK allows you to quickly and easily integrate your application with Cloudinary.
Effortlessly optimize and transform your cloud's assets.

### Additional documentation
This Readme provides basic installation and usage information.
For the complete documentation, see the [Java SDK Guide](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration).

## Version Support
| SDK Version    | Java 6+ |
|----------------|---------|
| 1.1.0 - 1.39.0 | V       |

## Installation
The cloudinary_java library is available in [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.cloudinary/cloudinary-core). To use it, add the following dependency to your pom.xml :

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.cloudinary</groupId>
    <artifactId>cloudinary-http45</artifactId>
    <version>1.39.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, download cloudinary_java from [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/cloudinary/cloudinary-core/1.30.0/cloudinary-core-1.30.0.jar) and [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/cloudinary/cloudinary-http44/1.30.0/cloudinary-http44-1.30.0.jar)
and see [build.gradle](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_java/blob/master/cloudinary-http44/build.gradle) for library dependencies.

## Usage
### Setup

Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `cloud_name` parameter set.
Each request to our secure APIs (e.g., image uploads, eager sprite generation) must have the `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters set.
See [API, URLs and access identifiers](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/solution_overview#account_and_api_setup) for more details.

Setting the `cloud_name`, `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters can be done either directly in each call to a Cloudinary method,
by when initializing the Cloudinary object, or by using the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable / system property.

The entry point of the library is the Cloudinary object.
```java
Cloudinary cloudinary = new Cloudinary();
```

Here's an example of setting the configuration parameters programatically:

```java
Map config = new HashMap();
config.put("cloud_name", "n07t21i7");
config.put("api_key", "123456789012345");
config.put("api_secret", "abcdeghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12");
Cloudinary cloudinary = new Cloudinary(config);
```

Another example of setting the configuration parameters by providing the CLOUDINARY_URL value to the constructor:

    Cloudinary cloudinary = new Cloudinary("cloudinary://123456789012345:abcdeghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12@n07t21i7");

### Transform and Optimize Assets
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_image_manipulation)
Any image uploaded to Cloudinary can be transformed and embedded using powerful view helper methods:

The following example generates the url for accessing an uploaded `sample` image while transforming it to fill a 100x150 rectangle:

```java
cloudinary.url().transformation(new Transformation().width(100).height(150).crop("fill")).generate("sample.jpg");
```

Another example, emedding a smaller version of an uploaded image while generating a 90x90 face detection based thumbnail:

```java
cloudinary.url().transformation(new Transformation().width(90).height(90).crop("thumb").gravity("face")).generate("woman.jpg");
```

You can provide either a Facebook name or a numeric ID of a Facebook profile or a fan page.

Embedding a Facebook profile to match your graphic design is very simple:

```java
cloudinary.url().type("facebook").transformation(new Transformation().width(130).height(130).crop("fill").gravity("north_west")).generate("billclinton.jpg");
```

### File upload
Assuming you have your Cloudinary configuration parameters defined (`cloud_name`, `api_key`, `api_secret`), uploading to Cloudinary is very simple.

The following example uploads a local JPG to the cloud:

```java
cloudinary.uploader().upload("my_picture.jpg", ObjectUtils.emptyMap());
```

The uploaded image is assigned a randomly generated public ID. The image is immediately available for download through a CDN:

```java
cloudinary.url().generate("abcfrmo8zul1mafopawefg.jpg");

# http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/abcfrmo8zul1mafopawefg.jpg
```

You can also specify your own public ID:

```java
cloudinary.uploader().upload("http://www.example.com/image.jpg", ObjectUtils.asMap("public_id", "sample_remote"));

cloudinary.url().generate("sample_remote.jpg");

# http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sample_remote.jpg
```
